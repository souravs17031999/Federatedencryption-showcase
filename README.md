# Project Objective :   
## This project aims to achieve federated learning training of model and then testing on encrypted dataset and model using pytorch and pysyft.

## Dataset : MNIST 
> (Intent behind using the simple dataset is the main motive which is to combine privacy preserving techniques using pysyft)

## Basic overview of federated learning :   

Have you ever wondered how Google keyboard predicts the probability of the words you will type after you just start typing ?
Or how the Apple iOS detects the most correct emoji you want to use in a conversation.

There are similar other things where we can see the use of federated learning like :
* wearable medical devices
* predictive maintenance (automobiles / industrial engines)
* ad blockers / autotomplete in browsers (Firefox/Brave)
* app company (Texting prediction app)
* so what exactly is federated learning ?
